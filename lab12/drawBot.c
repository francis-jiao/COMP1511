// game, without needing to look through all of the previous state

//   - call somebody out for forgetting to SAY_UNO / SAY_DUO / SAY_TRIO,

//   - play a card, *if* you have a valid card that you can play.
//
// It's not valid to end your turn unless you've done some other
// action/s (again, see the diagram).

// where we are at in our turn, and thus what move we should make.
